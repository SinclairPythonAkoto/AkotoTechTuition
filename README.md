# Akoto Tech Tuition #

This is a step by step guide I have created to learn the basics of Python!

I have broken up the tuition into 48 sessions; each session will come with a step by step guide / summary of the, along with the code available to view.

To get students started I have added the link to an online [Python compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) in order to be able to code without the need to install Python onto the computer straight away.  However this will be needed later on in the course, which I will go through.

I will also try to provide some useful links to extra learning resources available on *Google* and *YouTube* to futher enhance the student's knowledge.

This will not be a magic course that will turn a student from a non-programmer to an expert developer; but I plan and hope that after a student completes this tuition they will be ready to learn & explore more of Python independently, and understand the videos and resource materials they may choose to learn from.

### What is Python? ###
Python is a computer programming language that can do a range of things from build websites, automate tasks, to conduct data analysis.  Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to create a variety pf different programs and is not just used to solve specific problems.
This makes Python a very versitle language, and with a forever growing community!

Python is growing to become a very popular language; you may ask yourself why - well here's a few reasons:
- **Simple syntax:** it mimics natural language so it is easier to read and understand.
- **Versitility:** it can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.
- **Open source:** it's free to use and distribute.
- **Modules & Libraries:** from 3rd parties are very extensive so makes it easier to write complex code and still growing.
- **Beginner friendly:** very popular language of choice for entry-level coders.

### Fundermentals of Python ###
- Data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Compound data structures
- Conditional logic, loops, functions
- Object-Orientated Programming and using external libraries
